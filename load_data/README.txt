This Program is for lab 8

It will complete the following task:

Use a function called get_latest_data(dates, cpi)
    It will reference pull_date
    And load data into the database up to that date

This function will be run using a loop to simulate various uses

We will compare the different methods (append, trunc, and incremental)
