# Fred and Angel API
Welcome to the first API made by Fred and Angel!

## What it is about this API?
This API provides a user-friendly display of the total population for the years 2010, 2015, and 2022. The data is categorized by country, region, and year, making it easier for various users—including civil society, academia, and public policy professionals—to analyze the information.

Given that the database is somewhat large, we appreciate your patience when loading and visualizing tables, charts, and especially maps.
