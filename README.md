## Welcome to Fred and Angel API README
Welcome to the first API made by Fred and Angel!

## What it is about this API?
This API provides a user-friendly display of the total population for the years 2010, 2015, and 2022, at its first stage, to download this data. The data is categorized by country, region, and year, making it easier for various users—including civil society, academia, and public policy professionals—to analyze the information.

Given that the database is somewhat large, we appreciate your patience when eventually loading and visualizing tables, charts, and especially maps, and also when downloading JSON or CSV files.

## Overview
This API provides access to data stored in a CSV file hosted on GitHub. Users can retrieve, filter, and paginate records in JSON or CSV format.
